## Nexus 6 Checker

This little command-line script monitors the Google Play Store product pages for the four Nexus 6 models. When the inventory of one or more of them changes, a Pushbullet notification is pushed to the specified channel.

### Usage

Usage is relatively straightforward:

    nexus6checker.py [--interval SECONDS] [--debug] CHANNEL ACCESS_TOKEN

Use the `--help` switch to find out more about each parameter.
